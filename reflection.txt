Using braches will help team members be able to implement and share their ideas without completely committing to one person's vision. With branches, multiple people can brainstorm how a specific feature can work as it get implemented, before it gets pushed out to the public. Branches can prevent issues such as conflicts in timing, conflicts with documenting changes, and organizing features. In the lab, we used branches to lightly demonstrate how branches can organize a team's workflow.
